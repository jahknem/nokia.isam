version_added: 1.0.0
author: Jan KÃ¼hnemund
notes:
- Tested against Nokia ISAM 6.2.04ng
- This module works with connection C(network_cli)
- 'Implements CLI command: C(configure debug-trace ()'

    description:
    - A list of debug-trace protocol-trace configurations
    - Each entry represents one resource to be configured

        - msg type used to log trace msgs to syslog mandatory parameter
        - 'Possible values: C(tracing1) - msg type tracing1 used for syslog; C(tracing2)
          - msg type tracing2 used for syslog; C(tracing3) - msg type tracing3 used
          for syslog; C(tracing4) - msg type tracing4 used for syslog'
        choices:
        - tracing1

  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed)
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the device
    - by executing the command C(info configure debug-trace protocol-trace)
    - For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required
    type: str
  state:
    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) do not perform any changes
      on the device
    - State I(merged) - Merges the provided configuration with existing configuration
    - State I(replaced) - Replaces the configuration of specified resources
    - State I(overridden) - Overrides all resource configurations with provided config
    - State I(deleted) - Deletes the specified resource configurations
    - State I(gathered) - Gathers current configuration from the device and returns
      structured data
    - State I(rendered) - Renders the configuration as CLI commands without connecting
      to device
    - State I(parsed) - Parses the configuration from C(running_config) parameter
      into structured data
    type: str
