  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed)
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the device
    - by executing the command C(info configure bridge)
    - For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required
    type: str
  state:
    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) do not perform any changes
      on the device
    - State I(merged) - Merges the provided configuration with existing configuration
    - State I(replaced) - Replaces the configuration of specified resources
    - State I(overridden) - Overrides all resource configurations with provided config
    - State I(deleted) - Deletes the specified resource configurations
    - State I(gathered) - Gathers current configuration from the device and returns
      structured data
    - State I(rendered) - Renders the configuration as CLI commands without connecting
      to device
    - State I(parsed) - Parses the configuration from C(running_config) parameter
      into structured data
    type: str
