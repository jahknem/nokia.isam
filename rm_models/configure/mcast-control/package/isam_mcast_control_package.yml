module: isam_mcast_control_package
short_description: Resource module to configure mcast-control package
description:
- Configures mcast package bitmaps. The package is intended primarily for use by a
  network/element manager, such as an AMS, to support multiple sets of packages in
  different regions. A package is a group of zero or more multicast sources that share
  a common access permission. Grouping the source channels into one or more packages
  provides flexibility for the service provider to deliver different levels of services
  to the end users; for example, "Basic Package", "Middle-Tier Package", and "Premium
  Package". NOTE:There is no requirement to configure the package. If the package
  is modified, there is no effect on the multicast source.
- Supports configuration of name, template name, template version
version_added: 1.0.0

  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed)
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the device
    - by executing the command C(info configure mcast-control package)
    - For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required
    type: str
  state:
    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) do not perform any changes
      on the device
    - State I(merged) - Merges the provided configuration with existing configuration
    - State I(replaced) - Replaces the configuration of specified resources
    - State I(overridden) - Overrides all resource configurations with provided config
    - State I(deleted) - Deletes the specified resource configurations
    - State I(gathered) - Gathers current configuration from the device and returns
      structured data
    - State I(rendered) - Renders the configuration as CLI commands without connecting
      to device
    - State I(parsed) - Parses the configuration from C(running_config) parameter
      into structured data
