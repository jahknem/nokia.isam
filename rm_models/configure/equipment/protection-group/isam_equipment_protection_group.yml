module: isam_equipment_protection_group
short_description: Resource module to configure equipment protection-group
description:
- Configures a protection group. The protection group is identified by the eqptProtGroupId
  attribute (index). The value 1 is reserved for extension chain protection group
  which is always present and cannot be deleted. The protection group(s) are created
  implicitly by the system as part of the default configuration. Use "show equipment
  protection-group" to display the valid protection group identifier(s). Note that
  the default admin-status for protection-group 1 at system level is locked where
  it is always unlocked at cli level.
- Supports configuration of admin status, eps quenchfactor
version_added: 1.0.0
