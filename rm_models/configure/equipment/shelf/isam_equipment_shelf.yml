short_description: Resource module to configure equipment shelf
description:
- 'Configures the shelf. The operator can configure the following parameters: - class:
  the classification of the shelf. The following shelf classes are supported: -- main-ethernet:
  supports Ethernet-based traffic. Shelves in this class can contain NT and LT units.
  There must be at least one shelf of this class in the system. -- ext-ethernet: supports
  Ethernet-based traffic. Shelves in this class can only contain LT units. - planned-type:
  the type planned for this shelf. The not-planned parameter indicates that a shelf
  will not be inserted at this position. - lock: locks or unlocks the shelf. - shelf-mode:
  the shelf mode. When the shelf mode was changed successfully, the NE will reboot
  automatically. - description: text that describes the location of the shelf.'
- Supports configuration of class, planned type, lock and more
version_added: 1.0.0
