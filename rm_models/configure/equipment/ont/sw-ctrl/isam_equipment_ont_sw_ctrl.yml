short_description: Resource module to configure equipment ont sw-ctrl
description:
- 'This command creates an association between an ONT hardware version/variant and
  an ONT software version (download and planned). hw-version - has the same meaning
  as the eqpt-ver-num parameter supported by ''show equipment ont interface'' command.
  Special character * (asterisk) may be provided in the string which means that the
  * character (and all subsequent character positions) are considered to be automatic
  ''matches'' for values in same character positions of eqpt-ver-num parameter. ont-variant
  - has the same meaning as the plnd-var in ''configure equipment ont interface''
  command Note: Combination of hw-version and ont-variant must be unique. plnd-sw-version
  - has the same meaning as the ''auto-sw-plnd-ver parameter supported by ''show equipment
  ont interface'' command. sw-dwload-ver - has the same meaning as the ''auto-sw-dld-ver
  parameter supported by ''show equipment ont interface'' command.'
- Supports configuration of hw version, ont variant, plnd sw version and more
version_added: 1.0.0
