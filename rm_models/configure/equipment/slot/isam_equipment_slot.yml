short_description: Resource module to configure equipment slot
description:
- 'Configures a slot. The slot is identified by the physical slot number. The left-most
  slot in the shelf is number 1. The following parameters can be configured for the
  slot: - planned-type: the unit type that will be inserted into the slot. The not-planned
  parameter indicates that a unit will not be inserted into that slot. - power-down:
  the operator can power-up or power-down slots. This is only applicable to LSM. -
  unlock: the operator can lock or unlock a unit. A unit in the locked state cannot
  be used. This attribute is only supported for the NT (the system will refuse to
  lock the NT of a simplex system), EXT, and a managed LSM. This attribute is not
  applicable to sealed remote products (7367 SX). - alarm-profile: the operator can
  assign a customizable alarm profile to a NT or LSM board. This is applicable for
  all NTs and LSMs. - capab-profile:This parameter only applies to LSMs,NTIOs and
  mini-NT NRNT-A.For BCM based LSM boards default capab-profile is "default" for Intel
  based LSM boards it is "8vc_default". - disable-key: This Paramer should contain
  string between 8 and 16 characters; must contain at least one lowercase letter,
  one uppercase letter, one numeric digit, and one special character, but cannot contain
  whitespace.'
- Supports configuration of planned type, power down, unlock and more
