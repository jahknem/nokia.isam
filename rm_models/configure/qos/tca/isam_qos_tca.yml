module: isam_qos_tca
short_description: Resource module to configure qos tca
description:
- Configures various parameters related to subscriber interface and queue level traffic
  load and packet loss. Load per physical line is calculated by matching the total
  number of bytes transmitted versus the capacity of the interface in the relevant
  measurement epoch. Load per queue is measured in terms of the contribution to the
  interface level load of traffic passed in a certain queue. Threshold crossing alarms
  can be specified for the load and packet loss parameters per line and per traffic
  class. This feature can be useful to detect network anomalies by watching over packet
  discard or load level in high-priority traffic classes.

notes:
- Tested against Nokia ISAM 6.2.04ng
- This module works with connection C(network_cli)
- 'Implements CLI command: C(configure qos tca ()'
options:
  config:
    description:
    - A list of qos tca configurations
    - Each entry represents one resource to be configured
    type: list
    elements: dict
    suboptions:
      name:
        type: str
        required: true
        description:
        - The resource identifier
  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed)
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the device
    - by executing the command C(info configure qos tca)
    - For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required
    type: str
  state:
    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) do not perform any changes
      on the device
    - State I(merged) - Merges the provided configuration with existing configuration
    - State I(replaced) - Replaces the configuration of specified resources
    - State I(overridden) - Overrides all resource configurations with provided config
    - State I(deleted) - Deletes the specified resource configurations
    - State I(gathered) - Gathers current configuration from the device and returns
      structured data
    - State I(rendered) - Renders the configuration as CLI commands without connecting
      to device
    - State I(parsed) - Parses the configuration from C(running_config) parameter
      into structured data
    type: str
    choices:
    - merged
    - replaced
    - overridden
    - deleted
    - gathered
    - rendered
    - parsed
    default: merged
