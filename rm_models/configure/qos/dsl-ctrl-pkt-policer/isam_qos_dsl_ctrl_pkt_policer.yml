short_description: Resource module to configure qos dsl-ctrl-pkt-policer
description:
- Configures a upstream QoS Dsl Control Packet Policer.This control packet policer
  serves to prevent DoS attacks from subscriber premises against the control plane
  of the ISAM. The policing parameters that can be configured are the sustainable
  rate in packets/sec and the maximum burst size in packets. Control packets arriving
  at a higher rate then the sustainable rate are dropped by the policer. Control packets
  arriving in a longer burst then the maximum burst size are dropped by the policer.
  Control packets are packets directed to the LSM itself or inserted by the LSM. The
  control packet protocol type depends on the applied forwarding model, and can be
  802.1x, ARP, RIP, DHCP, IGMP, PPPoEDiscovery , PPP LCP, PPP control, PPP LCP termination
  acknowledgement. Policing is not applied on control packets inserted by the LSM.
  This command allows the operator to control the DSL line level control packet policer
  (enable or disable) for control protocol packets that remains in the data plane.
  And this feature is supported only for ARP and RIP protocol.
- Supports configuration of sustained rate, burst size, protocol ctrl
