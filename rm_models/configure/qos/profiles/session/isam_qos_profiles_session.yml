short_description: Resource module to configure qos profiles session
description:
- This commmand allows the operator to configure the QoS session profile. The QoS
  session profile is the main building block for conveying user traffic contractual
  rights and treatment. The QoS session profile is a "macro"-profile, which consists
  of individual settings as well as references to smaller profiles. A QoS session
  profile is composed of - a logical flow type, - a marker profile, - two policer
  profiles for up and downstream policing, - two lists for upstream and downstream
  policy conditions and actions. - tag selection for downstream scheduler. The logical
  flow type is a legacy parameter which is ignored. Any value is interpreted as "Generic",
  that is, the QoS session profile can be attached to any interface. If the QoS session
  profile contains settings that are not supported on the interface, then these are
  silently ignored by the system.
- Supports configuration of logical flow type, up policer, down policer and more
version_added: 1.0.0
