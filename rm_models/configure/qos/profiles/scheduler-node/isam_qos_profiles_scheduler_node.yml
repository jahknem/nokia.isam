short_description: Resource module to configure qos profiles scheduler-node
description:
- Configures a QoS scheduler node profile. The scheduler node profiles contain configuration
  settings for the data plane schedulers. These scheduler node profiles are applicable
  to downstream schedulers on the L3 line cards. The scheduler node settings on the
  service hub can be modified separately.
- Supports configuration of priority, weight, shaper profile and more
version_added: 1.0.0
author: Jan KÃ¼hnemund
notes:
- Tested against Nokia ISAM 6.2.04ng
- This module works with connection C(network_cli)
- 'Implements CLI command: C(configure qos profiles ()'
