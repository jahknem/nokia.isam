short_description: Resource module to configure qos profiles policy-action
description:
- 'Configures a QoS policy action profile. A QoS policy action contains: discard packet,
  set a DSCP value, set a Dot1P value, policing with a policer, policer sharing,count
  attribute. Dot1P and DSCP values are set to frames matched by the filter associated
  with this policy action. The forwarding action for the frames matched by the filter
  can be discard or pass. The default forwarding action is pass. When the forwarding
  action is discard, the other policy actions in this entry will not be checked; the
  frame will be discarded immediately. Policy sharing causes multiple QoS subflow
  with the same policy action profile to share their policer instance, in case they
  are set up within the same session profile in the same direction. Count configures
  whether the traffic classified by filter needs to be counted. Count means enable
  to count the traffic classified by filter, no count means disable to count the traffic
  classified by the filter. Default value is no count.'
- Supports configuration of dscp value, dot1p value, discard packet and more
version_added: 1.0.0
