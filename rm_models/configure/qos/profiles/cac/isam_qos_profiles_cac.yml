module: isam_qos_profiles_cac
short_description: Resource module to configure qos profiles cac
description:
- Configures a connection admission control (CAC) profile. CAC profiles are used primarily
  for multicast video admission control. CAC profiles can be attached to subscriber
  interfaces. The scope of a CAC profile is a DSL link (and not a PVC), regardless
  of the number of PVCs on a DSL link. The system derives the line rate from the physical
  interfaces and calculates an estimate of the available Ethernet bandwidth using
  configurable overhead factors. The line rate taken into account may be the guaranteed
  sync rate or the actual line rate in case of DSL, based on a global configuration
  setting. From this bandwidth, a part can be reserved for voice and data applications
  and the remaining part will be kept by the system as the available bandwidth for
  multicast video. Only preconfigured multicast streams are considered for CAC. Note
  that unicast video (regardless of whether it is premium content or generic Internet
  streaming video) is ignored by the CAC function. The maximum bandwidth that video
  will occupy can be further confined using the maximum multicast bandwidth 'max-mcast-bandwidth'
  parameter. CAC profiles are applicable to line cards, but not to SHub/IHub interfaces.
- Supports configuration of res voice bandwidth, max mcast bandwidth, res data bandwidth
  and more
