short_description: Resource module to configure qos profiles shaper
description:
- Configures a QoS shaper profile. A QoS shaper profile contains all settings related
  to a shaper. The ISAM supports single token bucket shapers. EIR is only applicable
  if shaper type is singleTokenBucketGpon. CBS is applicable only if the shaper type
  is singleTokenBucket. The L2+ line cards support shaping on queue. 1. GPON supports
  EIR and CIR. If CBS is non-zero for GPON; CLI will return an error. 2. DSL doesn't
  support EIR. So if user enters non-zero for EIR for DSL; CLI will return an error.
- Supports configuration of committed info rate, committed burst size, excess info
  rate and more
version_added: 1.0.0
