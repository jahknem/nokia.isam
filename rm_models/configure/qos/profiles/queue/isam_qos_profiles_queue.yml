short_description: Resource module to configure qos profiles queue
description:
- Configures a QoS queue profile. A queue profile or buffer acceptance control (BAC)
  profile contains configuration information on data plane queues. BAC profiles can

notes:
- Tested against Nokia ISAM 6.2.04ng
- This module works with connection C(network_cli)
- 'Implements CLI command: C(configure qos profiles ()'
options:
  config:

    - A list of qos profiles queue configurations
    - Each entry represents one resource to be configured

    suboptions:
      name:
        type: str
        required: true

        - (name) - A unique profile name

        type: str
        description:
        - 'identify the threshold unit type with default value: "packet"'
        - 'Possible values: C(packet) - the unit of discard threshold is packet; C(byte)
          - the unit of discard threshold is byte'

        choices:
        - packet
        - byte
  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed)
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the device
    - by executing the command C(info configure qos profiles queue)
    - For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required
    type: str
  state:
    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) do not perform any changes
      on the device
    - State I(merged) - Merges the provided configuration with existing configuration
    - State I(replaced) - Replaces the configuration of specified resources
    - State I(overridden) - Overrides all resource configurations with provided config
    - State I(deleted) - Deletes the specified resource configurations
    - State I(gathered) - Gathers current configuration from the device and returns
      structured data
    - State I(rendered) - Renders the configuration as CLI commands without connecting
      to device
    - State I(parsed) - Parses the configuration from C(running_config) parameter
      into structured data
    type: str
    choices:
    - merged
    - replaced
    - overridden
    - deleted
