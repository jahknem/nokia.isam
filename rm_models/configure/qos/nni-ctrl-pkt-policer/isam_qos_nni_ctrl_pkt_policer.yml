short_description: Resource module to configure qos nni-ctrl-pkt-policer
description:
- Configures a upstream QoS Nni Control Packet Policer.This control packet policer
  serves to prevent DoS attacks from subscriber premises against the control plane
  of the ISAM. The policing parameters that can be configured are the sustainable
  rate in packets/sec and the maximum burst size in packets. Control packets arriving
  at a higher rate then the sustainable rate are dropped by the policer. Control packets
  arriving in a longer burst then the maximum burst size are dropped by the policer.
  Control packets are packets directed to the LSM itself or inserted by the LSM. The
  control packet protocol type depends on the applied forwarding model, and can be
  802.1x, ARP, RIP, DHCP, IGMP, PPPoEDiscovery , PPP LCP, PPP control, PPP LCP termination
  acknowledgement. Policing is not applied on control packets inserted by the LSM.
- Supports configuration of sustained rate, burst size
version_added: 1.0.0

  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed)
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the device
    - by executing the command C(info configure qos nni-ctrl-pkt-policer)
    - For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required
    type: str
  state:
    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) do not perform any changes
      on the device
    - State I(merged) - Merges the provided configuration with existing configuration
    - State I(replaced) - Replaces the configuration of specified resources
    - State I(overridden) - Overrides all resource configurations with provided config
    - State I(deleted) - Deletes the specified resource configurations
    - State I(gathered) - Gathers current configuration from the device and returns
      structured data
    - State I(rendered) - Renders the configuration as CLI commands without connecting
      to device
    - State I(parsed) - Parses the configuration from C(running_config) parameter
      into structured data
    type: str
    choices:
    - merged
    - replaced
    - overridden
    - deleted
    - gathered
    - rendered
    - parsed
