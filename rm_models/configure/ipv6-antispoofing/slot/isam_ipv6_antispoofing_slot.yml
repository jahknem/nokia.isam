module: isam_ipv6_antispoofing_slot
short_description: Resource module to configure ipv6-antispoofing slot
description:
- Configures the bit length of the IPv6 address on which IPv6 anti-spoofing based.
- Supports configuration of bit len
version_added: 1.0.0
author: Jan KÃ¼hnemund
notes:
- Tested against Nokia ISAM 6.2.04ng
- This module works with connection C(network_cli)
- 'Implements CLI command: C(configure ipv6-antispoofing slot ()'
options:
  config:
    description:
    - A list of ipv6-antispoofing slot configurations
    - Each entry represents one resource to be configured
    type: list
    elements: dict
    suboptions:
      name:
        type: str
        required: true
        description:
        - The resource identifier for this configuration
        - (slot) - the physical number of the slot
      bit_len:
        type: str
        description:
        - 'bit length of the IPv6 address on which IPv6 anti-spoofing based with default
          value: "64" - number of bits that is checked during IPv6 address anti-spoofing.
          - range: [64,128]'
        default: '64'
  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed)
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the device
    - by executing the command C(info configure ipv6-antispoofing slot)
    - For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required
    type: str
  state:
    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) do not perform any changes
      on the device
    - State I(merged) - Merges the provided configuration with existing configuration
    - State I(replaced) - Replaces the configuration of specified resources
    - State I(overridden) - Overrides all resource configurations with provided config
    - State I(deleted) - Deletes the specified resource configurations
    - State I(gathered) - Gathers current configuration from the device and returns
      structured data
    - State I(rendered) - Renders the configuration as CLI commands without connecting
      to device
    - State I(parsed) - Parses the configuration from C(running_config) parameter
      into structured data
    type: str
    choices:
    - merged
    - replaced
    - overridden
    - deleted
    - gathered
    - rendered
    - parsed
    default: merged
