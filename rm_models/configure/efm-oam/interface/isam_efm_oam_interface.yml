module: isam_efm_oam_interface
short_description: Resource module to configure efm-oam interface
description:
- This command will allow the operator to enable/disable EFM OAM on the specified
  Ethernet-like interface and configure the mode, alive timer and response timer intervals.
  In addition also the internal traffic generator data applicable to this interface
  can be configured.
- Supports configuration of admin up, passive mode, keep alive intvl and more
version_added: 1.0.0
