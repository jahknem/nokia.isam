# Using overridden state

# Before state:
# =============
#
# Run on device to capture current settings for this resource:
#    info configure interface atm-pvc
# Example output:
#    customer-id "vip_customer_2"

- name: Override interface atm-pvc configuration back to default
  isam_interface_atm_pvc:
    state: overridden
    config:
      - name: "1/1/atm:0/0"
        customer_id: "available"

# After state:
# ============
#
# Re-run the same info command to show the effect:
#    info configure interface atm-pvc
# Expected output:
#    customer-id "available"
