# Using deleted state

# Before state:
# =============
#
# Run on device to capture current settings for this resource:
#    info configure interface cage
# Example output:
#    operational-mode dual-gpon

- name: Delete interface cage configuration
  isam_interface_cage:
    state: deleted
    config:
      - name: "1/1"

# After state:
# ============
#
# Re-run the same info command to show the effect:
#    info configure interface cage
# Expected output:
#    (configuration removed, interface returns to default state)
