short_description: Resource module to configure dual-parenting peer-node
description:
- 'Configures peer node. The system will decide which port of the two becomes active.
  In case of failure of one port the other port will take over. A forced switchover
  can also be triggered manually by the operator. The port protection group is identified
  by the first port in the group that is intended to be protected. The following parameters
  can be configured for the protection group : - peer-node-id: the peer-node-id that
  will ensure the protection of the first one.'
- Supports configuration of node name, sync vlan
version_added: 1.0.0

    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed)
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the device

  state:
    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) do not perform any changes
      on the device
    - State I(merged) - Merges the provided configuration with existing configuration
    - State I(replaced) - Replaces the configuration of specified resources
    - State I(overridden) - Overrides all resource configurations with provided config
    - State I(deleted) - Deletes the specified resource configurations
    - State I(gathered) - Gathers current configuration from the device and returns
      structured data
    - State I(rendered) - Renders the configuration as CLI commands without connecting
      to device
    - State I(parsed) - Parses the configuration from C(running_config) parameter
      into structured data
