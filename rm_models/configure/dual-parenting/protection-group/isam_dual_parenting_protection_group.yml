short_description: Resource module to configure dual-parenting protection-group
description:
- 'Configures dual-parenting protection group. The system will decide which port of
  the two becomes active. In case of failure of one port the other port will take
  over. A forced switchover can also be triggered manually by the operator. The port
  protection group is identified by the first port in the group that is intended to
  be protected. The following parameters can be configured for the protection group
  : - local-port-index: the local-port-index that will ensure the protection of the
  first one.'
- Supports configuration of prot type, peer node name, protection group id
version_added: 1.0.0

    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) do not perform any changes
