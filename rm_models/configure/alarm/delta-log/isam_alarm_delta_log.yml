short_description: Resource module to configure alarm delta-log
description:
- Configures the action of the system when the alarm log buffer is full. If the action
  is set to wrap, older log records are overwritten by recent records. If the action
  is set to halt, logging is stopped until the log buffer is reset.
- Supports configuration of indet log full action, warn log full action, minor log
  full action and more
version_added: 1.0.0
