module: isam_port_protection
short_description: Resource module to configure port-protection
description:
- 'Configures a protection group on two ports which will then operate in redundancy.
  The system will decide which port of the two becomes active. In case of failure
  of one port the other port will take over. A forced switchover can also be triggered
  manually by the operator. The port protection group is identified by the first port
  in the group that is intended to be protected. The following parameters can be configured
  for the protection group : - paired-port: the paired port that will ensure the protection
  of the first one.'
- Supports configuration of paired port
version_added: 1.0.0

    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) do not perform any changes

    - State I(deleted) - Deletes the specified resource configurations
    - State I(gathered) - Gathers current configuration from the device and returns
      structured data
    - State I(rendered) - Renders the configuration as CLI commands without connecting
      to device
