module: isam_alias
short_description: Resource module to configure alias
description:
- Configures CLI alias commands for the system. Alias names may not match any of the
  reserved cli node keywords. Alias names may not contain whitespace or chars '?'
  or '#'. Alias names may not match an existing alias value. Alias values may not
  contain chars '?' or '#'. '\n' or '\r' are disallowed unless they are used within
  literal string parameters. An alias value may not match an existing alias name.
  Cli command parameters entered as part of the alias value will not be validated
  until the alias is executed. The order of the displayed alias commands when executing
  the 'info configure alias' command does not persist after an NT switchover or reset.
