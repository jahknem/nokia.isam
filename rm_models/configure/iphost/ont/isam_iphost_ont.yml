- 'This command creates an IP host in the ONT.It must be created prior to creating
  services on an ONT that will use this IP stack. Prior to entering this command the
  following must have been already created: S-VLAN to associate for this stack The
  ONT for this stack If DHCP is enabled, the addressed obtain will override manual
  provisioning of ip-address, net-mask, default-router NOTE: Allowable range for IP
  address is 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 OLT prohibits the entry of the following range
  of well-known IP addresses: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (multicast) 127.0.0.0 to
